# Quick Draw

Description
- This is my first game made using the Unreal Engine 5. It is a minigame losely based 
on a Kirby minigame in which you have to beat your opponent by pressing a button first.
Most of the assets were taken from a guide that I was following, except for the bottom
left character (The one you play as), which was made by me. He is based off a "One Piece" character
and his name is Zoro.

- The objective of the game is to hit the opposing player first when the ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bffe5dde-8888-4196-a10a-8d9be2dc218a)
pops up by pressing spacebar. The frog is an AI that inherits the from the same swordsman class as the player.
The  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bffe5dde-8888-4196-a10a-8d9be2dc218a) pops up based off a randomized timer
that is set between two time intervals. The frog AI has a set time of when it can attack. It can be modified to make the game
harder. If the player presses spacebar to early then a  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bffe5dde-8888-4196-a10a-8d9be2dc218a)
will appear and they will be unable to move, losing them the game.
